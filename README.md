This repository showcases applied analytics, machine learning, and causal inference projects using real-world datasets and business-driven problem framing. Across domains (crypto, healthcare, robotics, public policy), I focus on building reproducible analyses and communicating results in an executive-ready way.

### 1. Stablecoin Ecosystem Dashboard (SQL, Dune Analytics)
- Built end-to-end SQL analytics pipelines on blockchain data
- Analyzed USDT adoption, transfer volume, wallet concentration, and peg stability
- Evaluated stablecoins as a scalable payment rail

### 2. Healthcare RCT Impact Study (R) 
- Conducted causal inference using randomized controlled trial data
- Estimated treatment effects on healthcare utilization and cost
- Delivered statistically grounded policy recommendations

### 3. Humanoid Robotics Strategy Analysis (Wolfram)
- Compared **Tesla Optimus vs Agility Digit** using mixed-method analytics: text signals, visuals, leadership “DNA,” and investment framing  
- Translated technical findings into executive insights about **readiness, credibility, and go-to-market narratives**  
- Built a risk-aware investment lens (single-stock vs diversified ecosystem exposure) using HUMN holdings + TSLA benchmarking
- 

### 4. Teenage Driving & Mortality (Regression Discontinuity, R)
- Applied a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal impact of driving eligibility on teen mortality
- Analyzed changes in all-cause and motor vehicle–related death rates around the legal driving age cutoff
- Produced policy-relevant insights on early-driver risk and graduated licensing interventions
 

## Core strengths
- **Business translation:** turning code, models, and metrics into decisions stakeholders can act on  
- **Causal inference:** RCTs and regression discontinuity for credible impact estimation  
- **Analytics engineering:** clean pipelines, reproducible workflows, and well-documented outputs  
- **Storytelling with data:** visuals + structured narratives built for non-technical audiences
