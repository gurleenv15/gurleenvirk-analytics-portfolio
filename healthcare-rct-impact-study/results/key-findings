## Key Findings

- Randomization was successful: no statistically significant differences in healthcare spending between treatment and control groups prior to program implementation.
- Intent-to-Treat (ITT) estimates show no statistically significant reduction in total, office, prescription, or hospital spending from being offered the wellness program in the first year.
- Participants exhibited substantially lower healthcare spending than non-participants, but these differences are not causal.
- Large participant vs. non-participant effects relative to small ITT effects highlight the role of selection bias.

## Recommendation

Employers should be cautious when evaluating wellness program ROI based on observational comparisons.
Randomized evaluations suggest that short-run healthcare cost savings are modest, and industry-reported savings may be overstated.
