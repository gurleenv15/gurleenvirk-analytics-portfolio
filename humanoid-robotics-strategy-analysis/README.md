# Humanoid Robotics: Strategy, Branding, and Investment Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes how Tesla (Optimus) and Agility Robotics (Digit) position humanoid robots as the future of industrial labor. Using text analysis, visual theme tagging, leadership background evaluation, and investment data, the project evaluates which narrative appears more credible from a business and investment standpoint.

## Key Questions
- How do robotics companies frame humanoid labor: long-term AI vision or near-term operational utility?
- Do leadership backgrounds align with stated strategy?
- Is it more rational to invest in a single visionary company or a diversified robotics ecosystem?

## Methods
- Website text analysis and keyword frequency comparison
- Visual theme categorization of marketing imagery
- Leadership and executive background analysis
- Geographic footprint mapping
- Investment comparison: Tesla vs HUMN Robotics ETF

## Key Findings
- Tesla emphasizes futuristic AI narratives and long-horizon disruption.
- Agility Robotics focuses on warehouse deployment, safety, and human-robot collaboration.
- Leadership backgrounds strongly reinforce each firm’s strategic posture.
- From a risk-adjusted perspective, diversified exposure via the HUMN ETF provides a more balanced entry into humanoid robotics.
