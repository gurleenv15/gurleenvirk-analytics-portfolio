## Data Sources

This folder stores **inputs** used by the analysis.

In this project, Agility text is imported directly from the website. Tesla's site is heavily scripted,
so plaintext import is unreliable. To keep the analysis consistent with what was analyzed in the notebook,
Tesla text is included manually.

This project relies exclusively on public, non-proprietary information:

- Tesla corporate website and Optimus AI materials
- Agility Robotics website, product pages, and leadership profiles
- Public executive biographies and LinkedIn summaries
- HUMN Robotics & AI ETF holdings and disclosures
- Public financial market data accessed via Wolfram Language

All categorization, interpretation, and synthesis were conducted independently.


Optional (recommended): store the full Tesla plaintext in a separate file (e.g., `tesla_about_manual.txt`)
to keep the Wolfram scripts readable.
