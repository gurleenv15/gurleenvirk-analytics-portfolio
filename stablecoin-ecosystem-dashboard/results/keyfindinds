## Key Findings

- Weekly USDT transfer volume structurally increased from ~$60–100B to ~$100–200B over the past two years.
- 59.6% of all transactions were under $1,000, indicating dominant retail, remittance, and small B2B usage.
- Weekly active wallets approximately doubled, reaching ~700k–850k in 2025.
- Returning wallets form the core user base, while new wallets show strong repeat usage.
- Volume growth occurred without peg instability, suggesting structural, payment-driven demand rather than speculative volatility.

## Recommendation

Proceed with a controlled rollout of USDT as a payment rail, prioritizing networks optimized for high-frequency, low-fee transactions.
