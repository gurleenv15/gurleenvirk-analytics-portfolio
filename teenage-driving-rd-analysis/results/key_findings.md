## Key Findings

- Reaching the minimum legal driving age causes a statistically significant increase in teen mortality.
- All-cause mortality increases by approximately 6–11 deaths per 100,000 teens per year.
- Motor vehicle accidents account for roughly 60–70% of the mortality increase.
- Effects are largest immediately around the eligibility cutoff, supporting a causal interpretation.
- Estimates are robust across non-parametric and parametric regression discontinuity specifications.

## Policy Implications

Results support graduated driver licensing policies, including nighttime driving restrictions,
passenger limits, and extended supervised learning periods to reduce early-driver risk.
